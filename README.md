# Image to Text & Text to Speech App
I guess everyone has faced this issue when you wanted to copy or extract some text from a screenshot/image but you couldn't and you ended up typing all the text by yourself. I think this app will really help and save some time of yours. It can recognize & extract all the text from an image and then you can directly copy-paste it anywhere you want.ðŸ˜Š

You can also listen to that text with the Text-to-Speech feature in many different Accents (British, American, French, Russian, German, Italian, Spanish).
This feature also helps you to practice pronunciation by giving you control of the speed & pitch of the speech.

Use Google Machine Learning SDK to extract text from an image for text recognition.
